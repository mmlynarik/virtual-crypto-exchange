# Virtual Crypto Exchange (VCE) Backend 

## 1. Install virtual environment
This project uses `uv` package manager. To properly install virtual environment, uv executable needs to be present in the system. If it's not, you can download and install it using curl:
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

After cloning the repository, the virtual environment can be set up using the command:
```
uv sync
```
